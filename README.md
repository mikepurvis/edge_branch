Edge Branch Management
======================

This is a simple script for managing an edge branch, which:

- Is regularly rebased on an active development branch.
- Has selected pull requests applied onto it each time.
- Is meant for integration testing, not development.

See for example: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/commits/kinetic-edge
